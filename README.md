"Music can heal the wounds that medicine cannot touch," as stated by Debasish Mridha, an American physician, philosopher, and author. On top of that, it has the potential to change the mood of a person instantly. 
Therefore, it provides us with adequate reason to organize and classify the vast world of music that keeps the listeners engaged and amplifies their experience. 
Accordingly, we have decided to make a music recommendation system using sentiment analysis.
Moreover, considering the existing technology which uses convolutional neural networks, in this project we have decided to bring a novel approach by using Quantum Neural Networks.
